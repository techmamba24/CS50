Problem Set 4

1. A header file that specifies exact-width integer types.
2. We use these different integer types so that we know exactly, and can specify the size of the integer to what we want to be (whehter it be 8 bit or 32 bit and positive or negative).
3. BYTE = 1Byte, DWORD = 4Bytes, LONG = 4Bytes, WORD=2Bytes
4. The first two bytes of a BMP in ASCII must be BM,
5. bfSize is the size of the complete file/bmp inlcuding the image, fileheade and infoheader.
   biSize is the size of the infoheader itself.
6. If the biheight is negative then the image is stored top down with the image beginning from the top left corner.
7. The biBitCount represents the BMP's color depth.
8. It may return a nullptr if the user puts a non-existent/unsupported file format in the command line, or a file name that the program cannot write to.
9. Because we always reading one struct at a time. First the fileheader, then the infoheader, and then one rgbtriple at a time.
10. If bi.width is 3, then line 65 of copy.c will assign the value of 3 to padding.
11. fseek moves the file position indicator to the desired position.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position in the file.
