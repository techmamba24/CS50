#   Simple program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height in which hashes represent blocks, similar to the 
#   double half-pyramid found toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers.
#   The half-pyramidâ€™s height which is entered by the user must be a non-negative integer no greater than 23.
